# Data-Wrangling-part
Before Data Wrangling we clean data first, In this small project I took randomly one of the dataset, I start (first data cleaning) to Data Wrangling
1) Feature Transformation:for Right skewed nth root and log(x) and for right skewed nth power and exponential methods and for both Boxcox Transformation also
2) Feature Scaling: In this I normalized data, and Standardize data. for Standardization substracting mean from data point divided by s.d. of data points. for Normalization I used Min-Max-Scaling, Robust Scaling, Max-Abs- Scaling
3) Feature Encoding : For Nominal data I used get_dummies(Pandas) and One-Hot-Encoding(Sklearn). For Oridinal Encoding i used label-Encoder, Ordinal-Encoder and map() function
4) Discretization: for this i used pandas for creating bins(it converts continuous data to discreate data).
